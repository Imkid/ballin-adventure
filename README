This is the first time I've looked at this project in a while.  I had 
experimented with it and some things were out of place or undefined, so I 
went in and fixed that and got the game back to a playable state:

- I made all the classes into separate header files
- I added a cMover class to differentiate between colliders that need to
calculate movement
- removed old todo's
