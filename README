vengeful-goomba README:

7/4/12
This is the first time I've looked at this project in a while.  I had been
experimenting with it and some things were out of place or undefined, so I 
fixed that and got the game back to a playable state.  I moved all the 
classes into their own separate header files and included them.

TODO list:
 - use virtual functions in cCollider class
 - make cMover class for colliders that need to calculate movement
 - make sprite (or pointer to sprite) a class member of cCollider/cMover
 - make movement smoother
 - make constructors set sprite rect coordinates
